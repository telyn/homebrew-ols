## Homebrew packaging for OpenBench Logic Sniffer

OpenBench Logic Sniffer is a cheap, open hardware logic analyzer that used to
be available to purchase through Seeed Studio.

The software that goes along with it has been in maintenance mode for a while,
and the published DMG no longer works correctly on modern macOS (at least 13.1,
but probably older than that too)
